Hello there! I am a Data Engineer at UBS in Zurich, Switzerland, specializing in developing ETL processes using Apache Spark and Databricks on cloud platforms.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Calabria, where I also served as a teaching assistant, focusing on secure software and network security.

Deeply immersed in the worlds of AI and Data Engineering, I also have a keen interest in video games and movies, which helps me balance my professional and personal life.
